Docker is a type of containerization platform that packages your application and all its dependencies together. This ensures that your application works seamlessly in any environment.

Docker is a popular Platform As A Service (PAAS) product. It uses virtualization at the operating system-level and delivers software in packages called containers. These make it easier for a developer to create, run, and deploy applications.

It is a unit of code that packages up a new code of an application that the developer is writing and all of its dependencies. It makes the application run faster between different computer settings.
